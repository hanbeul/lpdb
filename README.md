This is the testing branch. I (Michael) tried to setup testing suite with Mocha and Chai.
However, setting up a full testing suite is a lot more work than I thought.
Since testing itself won't be very useful at the current stage of development, 
I am abandoning this. 

If I want to pursue this again later and want to use what I've done so far here, 
see notes on my Notion's LPDB -> Unit Testing to get context of what I've done.

Testing itself works fine, BTW. Having it work with pre-existing docker container 
and hooking it with github actions for CI/CD is the next task.
