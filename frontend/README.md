## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## CSS Framework

I will be testing with a variety of UI frameworks to see which one works best. Whatever I decide to stick with, I will update here.

This will eventually be containerized using Docker, so other teammates can easily run the service later in their local machine.
